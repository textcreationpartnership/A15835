            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <p>As <hi>Gouernment</hi> is GOds ordinance not mans; So wee know that himselfe first established that Superioritie in the Creation: that euen amongst the lights of heauen, as some are lesser and subordinate, so other some of speciall eminencie and magnitude, as the Sunne and the Moone. <hi>Luminaria magna,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 1.16.</note> Great lights: and of these two, the Sunne, <hi>Luminare maius,</hi> a greater light: and as the greater for light, so the greater for honour, for it was made in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium Diei,</hi> for the gouernment of the <hi>Day;</hi> which, in the execution of that ordinance which God laid vpon it, standeth not immoueable as the North-pole, or as a Diamond fixed in a socket of Gold, but is in continuall motion and labour, fetching his course and conpasse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout alwaies in businesse and imployment. I his Prince of the lights of heauen, giues this light vnto the Princes and Magistrates of the earth, who are <hi>Luminaria magna,</hi> great <hi>Lights,</hi> that they must not be as Starres fixed in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Orbes, but they must be in motion, alway looking about them, standing in the gates, watching vpon the Towers, euermore studying and deuising for their peoples welfare.</p>
                     <p>This we finde also in the rest of the Creatures, which the Lord God created, which as they are the more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so the more operatiue &amp; working. I may reduce them all into foure Degrees, and begin at the lowest, whence the rest fetch their beginning. First the foure Elements, Fire, Ayre, Water, Earth: These haue but onely a being without Life, Sence or Reason. Yet of these wee know, some are more noble then other, some more pure, some more in operation and working; as the Fire more then the Ayre, the Ayre more then the Water, the Water more then the Earth. Of the second sort are things which ouer and beside their being, haue life, as Trees, Plants, Hearbs and Flowers; and these are distinguished into their rankes, as the Cedar in Lebanon farre more noble then the Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in the Forrest, and the Rose plant of Iericho, of better esteeme then the Woodbine of the Plaine. Proceede to a third sort, and these besides beeing, and life, haue also
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:24747:5"/>sence and motion, able to moue from place to place, as Beasts, Birds, and Fishes; and these are more or lesse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: for what is the Mouse to the Elephant, or the Dog to the Lyon, or the Flye to the Eagle, or the Kite to the Ostrich? Lastly, besides all these before mētioned, are they, who hauing sence, life, and motion, haue also Reason: and in this degree are, 1. <hi>Angels,</hi> the Legates and Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Heauen; and amongst these, there should seeme to be degrees of Soueraignty,
<note place="margin">Iude vers. 7.</note> else why should <hi>Michael</hi> bee an Archangell, and <hi>Gabriel</hi> none? yea and some more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed then others too,
<note place="margin">Luk. 1 26.</note> else why should <hi>Gabriel</hi> be Gods Embassadour to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> more then <hi>Raphael</hi> or any other? 2. <hi>Men:</hi> and these are the wonders of Nature if they wrong it not; for besides that goodly shape which they beare, there are two singular priuiledges they are endued with beyond all earthly creatures, <hi>ratio, &amp; oratio,</hi> Reason and Speech, And though I will not speake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Philosophers Fancie,
<note place="margin">Plato.</note> that some are of baser metall then others, the Prince of a more golden tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then the Vassal: Yet we know there is <hi>Potestas super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminentior,</hi> an higher power, <hi>Romans</hi> the 13.1.

Therefore God in singular wisedome, vsed a meanes to represse their violences; else reasonable men had beene farre worse then vnreasonable beasts, for neuer were the natures of other creatures more cruell, fell, sauage one to another, then the nature of man vnto man: had not God <hi>put an hooke into his nostrils, and a bridle into his lips,</hi> who though hee bare himselfe vp with insolencie and eagernesse of spirit, yet hee might be curb'd and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by them of his owne kinde, that whereas he had sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the yoke of obedience vnto God, was therefore inforced obedience vnto man, and of him to stand in awe. And thus through sinne came one man to haue power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer another, that some might know how to rule, and others to obey.</p>
                     <p>Hence comes it to passe, that in regard of the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse and insolencie of mans nature the disorder and vnrulinesse of his affections, so many wiles, crafts, subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and escapes, through corruption ingendered and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered in him, that nothing is of greater difficultie then to gouerne and rule man. It requires much art, skill, courage, and an high measure of wisedome, to keepe him in awe; <hi>Qui inter omnes animantes,
<note place="margin">Gregor. Nazian.</note> maxime est &amp; moribus varius &amp; voluntate diuersus,</hi> saith a Father, who amongst all the creatures of the world beside, is most stubbornly obliged and wedded to his will, and most exorbitant in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his life. And surely, though we need not maruell at his prouidence in greater matters, when the least things that are, are not gouerned without his prouidence; yet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:24747:6"/>herein it doth wonderfully appeare, that there should be such a feare put into the hearts of a multitude, to submit and subiect themselues to the yoke of one man, euen so many thousands to his power and command. Yet wee see it by <hi>Art:</hi> For the horse of noblest courage is made to obey with a slender bit: and a Ship though neuer so great, and driuen with fierce windes,
<note place="margin">Iam. 3.9.</note> yet is guided and turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a small rudder. Againe, we see it in <hi>Nature</hi> too. The fight of the eye, a very small thing: and the heart of man, but an handfull: yet is the one the <hi>light,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>life</hi> of the whole body. This amongst other, is a speciall argument of the prouidence of God,
<note place="margin">Psal 68.7. <hi>Secundum vulg. Transl.</hi>
                        </note> who <hi>causeth men to be of one minde,</hi> euen so many thousands, and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them together in dutie and allegeance, that one rule all, and all are ruled by that one.</p>
                     <p>Hence also ariseth that <hi>Ciuill order</hi> amongst the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, which notwithstanding the sinnes of men, God hath beene very carefull to preserue and keepe; and therefore hath his Deputies and Lieutenants vpon the earth, and vnder them subordinate rulers and gouernours, who haue the administration of Iustice and Iudgement. That as in the Frame and composure of the <hi>great World,</hi> he hath set the Fire aboue the Ayre, the Ayre aboue the Water, the Water aboue the Earth: and as in the structure and building of the <hi>little World,</hi> hee hath set the Knees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Feete, the Armes aboue the Knees, the Eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Armes; so in bodies politique hee hath set and placed one calling ouer another. Againe, as the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall Bodies haue a double motion, one common with the whole body of the heauens, the other proper and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, according to the nature of euery seuerall Starre; and in our bodies a double motion also: one whereof depends vpon the whole body, and therefore is vniuersall: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular, according to the inbred nature and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of euery seuerall member: So ouer and beside that <hi>vniuersall command,</hi> that the <hi>Supreme Magistrate</hi> vpon earth hath; whereby the whole body of a Kingdome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and subiecteth it selfe, there is a subordinate and a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:24747:7"/>deriued power, whereby, as through an inferiour motion: all parts and members of the body, euen vnto the Foote are ordered and gouerned; as of seuerall Counties in that Kingdome, of seuerall Cities in those Counties, of seuerall Families in those Cities, and of euery seuerall person in those Families.

Now, as when the mother or nurse dieth, the child hanging on her breast: she desires another might be as louing and kinde to it as her selfe: So godly and kinde Magistrates when they must leaue their places, will be desirous that they who succeed them in Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might succeede also in the same care, and loue vnto the people: and whilest they gouerne, to cherish the good, to represse the euill, to encourage the vertuous, to punish the wicked.
<note place="margin">Platt.</note> The Philosopher saith the whole body of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill order, consisteth but of these two things: <hi>rewarding</hi> and <hi>punishing.</hi> For as they must hate the sinnes of wicked

And this <hi>Burthen</hi> of <hi>Magistracie</hi> they they may the better beare, they must permit God to beare a part with them, to haue a roome in their Counsels, as chayre of Estate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. They must follow his directions, and not the affections of their owne hearts: they must not rule as they list, that were Tyrannie; but they must rule as they ought, and that is Princely. If they listen vnto his <hi>Word,</hi> renouncing their owne deuices, then shal they haue much comfort in their gouernment, and the iudgements of their mouthes shall be <hi>righteous Iudgements.

                     </list>
                     <p>First for the <hi>Persons,</hi> who committed this sinne: First,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:24747:18"/>
                        <hi>Iudah</hi> an honourable <hi>Patriarch,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Persons. Gen. 29. <hi>vlt.</hi>
                        </note> the sonne of <hi>Iacob</hi> by <hi>Leah:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Thamar:</hi> this, some haue thought to bee the Daughter of <hi>Sem,</hi> who was the High-Priest <hi>Melehs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeck,</hi> and hence was it, say they, that <hi>Iudah</hi> adiudgeth her to be burnt, because it was a Law, that if the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Priest did play the Harlot, shee should bee burnt. But this wil appeare to be but a vaine surmise, for though <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> liued 600. yeeres, yet hee liued not to the dayes of <hi>Iacob</hi> by ten yeeres: and <hi>Iacob</hi> being at this time an 100. yeeres of age, it is not like, that <hi>Thamar</hi> being of <hi>Sem,</hi> or <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> should be now child bearing. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of opinion, which is the more probable, that she was a Cananitish woman, and forsooke the Idolatry of her owne countrey, to worship the true God.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning this payre, thus met in this action, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers points are to be considered.
<note place="margin">1. Iudah.</note> First, that <hi>Iudah</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen two of his sonnes in marriage to this <hi>Thamar, Er</hi> and <hi>Onan:</hi> the first of them beeing wicked in the sight of the Lord, (and yet his wickednesse not expressed) therefore the Lord <hi>slew him;</hi> and by him shee had no issue. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he gaue his second sonne <hi>Onan</hi> vnto her, that he might raise vp seede vnto his brother; which order was for the continuance and preseruation of the stocke and Familie; and so the child begotten of the second brother should haue the name and inheritance of the first; which wee know was afterward confirmed by <hi>Moses:
<note place="margin">Deut. 25.1.</note> Hic mos fuit, crimen non fuit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">August.</note> to vse the words of Saint <hi>Augustine;</hi> this was then the manner, it was not holden for any fault. Now this second brother doing wickedly in the fight of the Lord, and his wickednesse mentioned, <hi>verse</hi> 9. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord <hi>slew</hi> him also, neither by him had shee any issue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iudah</hi> hauing thus lost two of his sonnes he dissembles with <hi>Thamar</hi> concerning the third, and here was the ground of all the future mischiefe: he wils her to remaine a Widdow till his third sonne <hi>Shelah</hi> were growne vp, and yet had no purpose to giue <hi>Shelah</hi> vnto her:
<note place="margin">Hinc illae La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymae.</note> For hee thought thus, <hi>ne forte moriatur etiam ipse;</hi> lest he die also
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:24747:18"/>as well as his other brethren, (for he supposed her to bee the only cause of the death of his other two sonnes.) Now this seemes to aggrauate <hi>Iudahs</hi> sinne, who perswades her to remaine a Widdow in hope of <hi>Shelah,</hi> and yet had no purpose to giue <hi>Shelah</hi> vnto her. So you see, all is not right with <hi>Iudah</hi> here at the very first.</p>
                     <p>Come we neerer to the matter it selfe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There is a saying fathered vpon Father <hi>Augustine: Malum est multierem videre, peius alloqui, pessimum tangere.</hi> It is ill enough to <hi>looke</hi> vpon a woman, worse to <hi>talke</hi> with her,
<note place="margin">Iob 31.1. 1. Cor. 7.2.</note> but worst of all to <hi>doe</hi> the worst of all. See here I pray, how <hi>Iudah</hi> treads euery step, and how wonderfully he was infatuate, besot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, blinded in this action. For first hee <hi>saw</hi> her, <hi>verse,</hi> 15. and iudging her by the manner of her sitting to bee an Harlot, he went and <hi>talked</hi> with her about the bargaine: to which, there went more then a word. For ere hee could strike it vp, there was first the promise of a Kid. Secondly,

All which, being duly considered, we may see how wholly he was giuen ouer vnto lust; and how great a measure of stupidity he was striken into, turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very stone after hee saw her,
<note place="margin">Ouid. Metam.</note> as they were who beheld <hi>Medusa.</hi> When all his sences, the stars of this <hi>lesser world,</hi> were ouercast with such a cloud,
<note place="margin">Prou. 6.32.</note> that his vnderstanding could not say vnto him, as the Ship-master said vnto <hi>Ionah,
<note place="margin">Ionah 1.6.</note> What meanest thou O sleeper?</hi> That neither his <hi>eye</hi> nor his <hi>eare,</hi> which he caried about with him as two secret Spies, could view or discerne this <hi>Iericho.</hi> It seemes his lusts had bored out his eies, as the <hi>Philistimes</hi> did <hi>Sampsons:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iudges 16.21.</note> or that for the time he had a spice of the <hi>Falling sicknesse; Plinio</hi> shewes the nature of it,
<note place="margin">Plinius Nat. hist.</note> that <hi>the eye being wide open sees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> The <hi>care</hi> haply spake to the <hi>eye,</hi> as <hi>Abimelech</hi> to the folke that were with him; <hi>as thou seest me doe,
<note place="margin">Iudges 9.49. 2. King. 25.1. Rom. 1.28.</note> doe thou the like.</hi> Ile be deafe, be thou blinde: and thus, as <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, blinde,</hi> and <hi>bound,</hi> was carried perforce to <hi>Babell:</hi> So <hi>Iudah</hi> to a worke of confusion, euen to <hi>doe</hi> the thing which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:24747:19"/>was not seemely. How greatly (thinke you) was this man dulled &amp; ouerborne by his affections? Which as it may be approued by many examples of the like nature, to set out mans nature in the like, so we cannot haue a better presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then from himselfe in another case. He tooke a wife, when he was very yong; and notwithstanding to haue affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie with the Cananites, was condemned of God as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, yet he marries into their stocke, and which is more, without consent of parents (which yet in his owne children he required.) And as <hi>Caesar</hi> abridged the manner of his victories ouer <hi>Egypt,</hi> in three words, <hi>Venit, vidit, vicit;</hi> He came, he saw, he ouercame; So in three words, <hi>Iudah</hi> huddles vp his bargaine with this Cananitish wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
<note place="margin">Verse 2.</note>
                        <hi>Vidit, accepit, cognouit:</hi> He <hi>saw</hi> her, he <hi>tooke</hi> her, he <hi>went in</hi> vnto her. Which shewes how rash and retchlesse we are without our right guide, yea and euen how shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in our actions, when God turnes vs ouer to our lusts, and to the sinfull affections of our owne hearts. Neither was this vnpunished in <hi>Iudah,</hi> thus matching himselfe into this accursed stocke: for God blessed him not; he grew so infortunate in his posteritie, that he might haue wished with <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Suetonius O Vtinam coelebs vixissem orbus{que} perissem.</note> he had had neither wife nor child. For euen the fruits of this Marriage, <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan</hi> were accursed of God. And thus will it euer come to passe, where God is neglected, and our carnall affections beares the sway.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, to come more neere to the matter it selfe. The fact thus committed with <hi>Thamar,</hi> he labours to conceale it as much as he can. For when he had sent the <hi>Kid,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the <hi>Pledge,</hi> and the Messenger could not finde her, he satisfies himselfe without further inquirie, <hi>Accipiat sibi,</hi> Let her take it, saith he, without more adoe, <hi>ne forte simus contemptui,</hi> lest if al come to light we be ashamed. Thus he feares man more then the God of Heauen that made man; and the shame of men he stands in more awe of, then the dreadfull presence and Maiestie of God. The credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his name, he preserues, prefers, <hi>Omnia si perdat,</hi> if hee lose all, yea euen God himselfe, who is all in all;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:24747:19"/>yet will he not incurre shame and reproch at the hands of men; as if God did shut vp his eyes in boxes, and were in a deepe slumber, as if his all-seeing eye were not present, yea, euen with them who would auoide his presence; as if he tooke no account of mans iniquitie, or that the holy One of Israel would not be reuenged.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to lay open the wound yet more.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> You heard before how he was ouer-borne with lust, with inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie; you shall now see him as farre ouer-gone with crueltie. I note it the rather, because they are vices which seldome doe abandon one another, especially if it be true, which some hold for a <hi>Maxime: Euery voluptuous Prince is cruell;</hi> and the more, if necessitie constraine him: as here this <hi>great man, Iudah</hi> adiudgeth <hi>Thamar</hi> for this fact to be burnt; not for any such reason I rendred before, but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he thought to be rid of <hi>Thamar,</hi> and so his sonne <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> might be at liberty to marry elsewhere. For no doubt had not this beene his purpose, he would not haue beene so forward, so resolute. He would rather haue expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her concerning the Fact; For was there no order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeding to be had? Doth hee settle his Iudgement vpon the first impression to haue her dispatched? Had she been married to two of his sonnes, <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan;</hi> and is his fauor no better, nay are his words so bitter, the words of death? Surely yea: here is but a word and a blowe. As peremptorie was he, as euer was <hi>Dauid;
<note place="margin">2. Sam. 11.5.</note> The man that hath done this shall surely dye;</hi> and little thought it concerned him so neere. <hi>Educite cam,</hi> Bring her forth,
<note place="margin">Verse 24.</note> he spake impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely, and this was <hi>generosum,</hi> and spoken like a King; but <hi>vt comburatur,</hi> that she may bee burnt, and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint not entred, her cause not heard, this was <hi>scelerosum,</hi> and spoken like a Tyrant. Nay, here is one thing more, that fils vp the measure of his iniquitie, and makes him wicked aboue measure; for hee would haue had her dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>patched being great with child. Here was <hi>nihil virtutis,</hi> besides the first sillable, <hi>nihil humanitatis</hi> besides the Name, <hi>Pietatis omni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o nihil.</hi> Nay rather <hi>Excede pietas,</hi> Be gone pietie, be gone. Though he had not regarded her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:24747:20"/>she had offended, yet (me thinkes) he should haue respected the poore infant, who offended not: could it speake to any other, then to the bowels that bare it? Or plead at any Barre either for it selfe, or the Mother; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as yet imprisoned in the Wombe, and not so soone enlarged, as it should haue beene enwrapped with the slames of Death?
<note place="margin">2. King. 8.</note> The teares in the eyes of <hi>Elisha</hi> I can scarce remember without teares; when so earnestly hee eyed <hi>Hazael,</hi> knowing that amongst other villanies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him, <hi>hee should rend in pieces women great with child:</hi> I pray, what answere made <hi>Hazael</hi> againe, <hi>Is thy seruant a Dogge that he should doe this thing?</hi> So brutish, so inhumane?
<note place="margin">Deut. 24.16.</note> How did God prouide against this Rigour, when he made a Law, that the Child should not suffer for the Father, nor the Father for the Child? When Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death passeth vpon a woman with child, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is deforred till she be deliuered. This was practised amongst the Athenians and it was the Law of the ancient Romans:
<note place="margin">

                        <note place="margin">Suetonius in vita Claudij Eras. in Paedagog.</note> Yet <hi>Suetonius</hi> (who wrote the liues of the twelue <hi>Caesars</hi>) and indeede he wrote (as <hi>Erasmus</hi> wittily, <hi>eàdem libertate quà ipsi vixerunt,</hi> euen as freely as they liued,) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Claudius,</hi> that he spared not to put to death wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men great with child.
<note place="margin">Generall Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Spaine. <hi>Pag.</hi> 420.</note> Such was that horrible outrage of the Sicilians vpon the French, mentioned in the generall Historie of Spaine, who slew them with such cruelty that where they knew any women of their owne Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten with child of the French, they ripped open their wombes, and slew both women and children, because they would be sure to leaue none of their French seede in the Countrey: answerable to this was the clemencie of Q.

                           <hi>Hexapla. in Gen. pag.</hi> 302.</note> and so much the more vniust, because this punishment was not arbitrarie in <hi>Iudah,</hi> for hee had no such authoritie; an honourable man hee was indeede, but no Magistrate there, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:24747:20"/>the execution of any such Iustice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iudah</hi> is now at the highest. Concerning <hi>Thamar,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Thamar.</note> if we pull off her vaile, we may easily see, that though it couered her face, yet it could not couer her sinne. For though <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> knew her not to be <hi>Thamar;</hi> yet <hi>Thamar</hi> knew him well inough to be <hi>Iudah:</hi> and it is more then manifest, that she willingly committed this Incest. And say she did it not in any desire of inordinate lust, as it is like she did not, but rather <hi>successionis gratia,</hi> desiring onely to haue issue: <hi>Et ex ea familia quam delegerat,</hi> and of that Family and Tribe too that shee had chosen. Nay goe further; say that shee desired issue by <hi>Iudah,</hi> in hope of the <hi>Messias,</hi> which could not be, for she was a Cananitish woman: and the Mysterie <hi>that the Messiah should come of Iudah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> was not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed: I say though her intention was neuer so good, yet doth it not make the action good. For it is not enough for a man to propound a good end, but the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is to accomplish it must be also good. The procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, a thing lawfull to be desired, and the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God goeth along in the vigour and strength of it, and God hath set downe a lawful order for the same, and that the generation of mankinde should runne in a right course; therefore it is wicked and abominable, by vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes to seeke to compasse it:
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> We know the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. therefore that which of it selfe is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good, it turnes to sin in vs, when it is compassed by vnlawfull meanes.</p>
                     <p>Againe, I doubt not but <hi>Thamar</hi> sinned euen against her conscience: For she knew shee did not well to put off her widdowes garment, and to disguise her selfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him. For she <hi>couered</hi> her face. Some say she <hi>colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> and painted her face;
<note place="margin">2.

                        <label>Obiect.</label>If it be obiected that this Law was not extant in <hi>Iudahs</hi> time, and therefore could be no Rule for him; <label>Answ.</label>I answere, that euen by the light of nature, <hi>Iudah</hi> had that written on the Table of his hart, which God afterward wrote in Tables of stone; whereby he knew he had not done well, and which might be some cause of his <hi>remorse,</hi> as afterward is declared. Againe, the practice of the godly, in the times wherin he liued, and the faithful traditions of the Fathers might discouer it to be a fault. The hauing of many wiues was a sinne. For God, for one <hi>Adam</hi> made but one <hi>Eue:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2 18.

<note place="margin">Gen. 29.30. Leah. Rahel. Ephes. 5.3.</note> there was no such custome; euen his Father <hi>Iacob</hi> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by going in to two Sisters. Concerning this sinne, I will not speake any more, it is not to be named but with hatred and detestation. Wee ought to pray vnto God that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:24747:21"/>he would keepe vs from these sinnes; our Families, our Cities, our Nation. For though God through his singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar prouidence can turne euill into good, and out of euill can produce good, as here of <hi>Iudahs</hi> incest with <hi>Thamar,</hi> vvho begat <hi>Phares,</hi> and <hi>Phares, Esrom,</hi> and <hi>Esrom, Aram;</hi> and so ye know the period of that line, Christ: Yet where these sins are committed, there can nothing be expected, but the dreadfull vengeance of God to bee powred out. And though we finde in Scripture, as one well obserueth,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Musculus super Gen. cap.</hi> 19.</note> that many vertuous women, accompanying with their husbands were barren, or at most, hardly conceiued; as <hi>Sara, Rebecca, Rahel, Anna:</hi> Contrariwise diuers others, saith he, <hi>vno illegitimo concubitu conceperunt,</hi> as <hi>Bethsheba</hi> with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and here <hi>Thamar</hi> with <hi>Iudah;</hi> and not onely <hi>vno,</hi> but <hi>primo,</hi> as <hi>Lots</hi> daughters being virgins, with their owne father: I say, though this comes to passe, yet doth it not argue, that God (vvho in this case blesseth nature, as it is his worke, and not the vnlawfull action of the vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,) fauoureth these vnlawfull commixtures any vvhit the more, but it shewes rather, that he will reueale, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and bring such secret wickednesse to light, vvhich to the vvicked and vnrepentant, vvorkes confusion: to them, in whom the remainders of grace are not wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, and vvhom God hath a purpose to reclaime, it vvorkes their conuersion, and amendment of their naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie life; as in <hi>Dauid</hi> was most apparent, and here in <hi>Iudah</hi> remaineth to be proued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The whole Scripture</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is giuen by inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and is profitable to teach and to instruct;

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, to lay open mans frailtie, and the infirmitie of his Nature; yea, euen of those <hi>Grand-fathers,</hi> the Beaupeeres of the world. Often wee finde in Scripture, men of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place, of great imployment, of speciall fauour vvith God, yet haue fallen very dangerously; as here <hi>Iudah</hi> into <hi>Incest</hi> with his daughter in Law;
<note place="margin">Gen. 19.36. Gen. 9.21. Gen. 20.12. 2. Sam. 11.4. Mat. 26.74. 1. Cor. 10.12.</note>
                        <hi>Lot</hi> into the same sinne with his owne daughters; <hi>Noah,</hi> vvho saw two vvorlds, into Drunkennesse; <hi>Abraham</hi> into Lying; <hi>Dauid</hi> into Murther and Adulterie; <hi>Peter</hi> denie Christ and forsweare him. The Apostles rule must here take place; <hi>Let him that thinketh he stand,
<note place="margin">Ambrose.</note> take heede lest he fall: Labi humanum, prolabi Diabolicū.</hi> We do freely confesse and acknowledge the infirmities of holy men, to the shame of this flesh and bloud that we beare about vs, and to the glorie of God. The Scripture hath not concealed them, and we ought to make a good vse of them; as an ancient Father saith, <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archae nos instruunt, non solū docentes, sed etiam errantes:</hi> we may learn many good instructions, as vvel from their sins, as from their graces; as vvell from their faults, as from their vertues. Therefore if these holy men of God, these Worthies of the world fell so dangerously, it should bee our dayly prayer vnto God, that hee vvould hold vs vp, against all the temptations of the Diuell, allurements of the vvorld, and prouocations of our Flesh vvhatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A second reason vvhy the <hi>Incest</hi> of these two is related, is this: yee know the manner of the Iew vvas much to boast of his pedigree and descent;
<note place="margin">Inuenall.</note>
                        <hi>Nil nisi Cecropides,</hi> I tell you he vvill be noble or nothing. In the 8. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> they told Christ to his face, that <hi>they were not the children of fornication:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iohn 8.41.</note> Now this serues to abate their pride and insolencie, here may they see what manner of beginning they had; here is the Rocke whence they vvere hewen, their generation is knowne to the vvorld. Let them look back to their great Ancestor, the Prince of their Tribe, and they shall finde sufficient matter of humiliation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the report of <hi>Iudahs Incest</hi> was yet for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause more then all the rest. Wee know that <hi>Christ</hi>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:24747:22"/>came of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah;</hi> and in that golden Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in the Gospell.
<note place="margin">Mat. 1.3.</note>
                        <hi>Iudah</hi> is numbred amongst others in the series and Ranke as Christs <hi>Ancestor,</hi> vvho begat <hi>Phares</hi> and <hi>Zara,</hi> of <hi>Thamar.</hi> Now the holy Ghost, in reckoning vp the progenie and descent of Christ, glanceth at the notorious sinnes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as he doth the like of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid;</hi> and therefore doth not onely say, <hi>hee begat Salomon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin"> Verse 6.</note> but addeth, <hi>of her who was the wife of Ʋriah:</hi> where <hi>Dauid</hi> is detected for his Murder and Adulterie. So <hi>Rahab</hi> the Harlot is also mentioned in that line, as an Ancestor of Christ, vvho was married to <hi>Salmon</hi> a Prince of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truth seekes no corners, and the holy Ghost vvho is the author of truth, vvill not conceale these grosse blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes and staines, euen in those, who according to the flesh were the ancestors of Christ. What should this meane? To haue our line drawne from <hi>incestuous</hi> and adulterous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures, we hold it no small infamie and disparagement. It is noted for a dishonour vnto <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Suetonius,</note> that his Father <hi>Drusus</hi> was begotten in Adulterie.
<note place="margin">Iudg. 11.1.</note>
                        <hi>Iphtah</hi> the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liadite was a valiant man, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11.1. but hee vvas the sonne of an <hi>Harlot,</hi> there is his blemish. <hi>Iudah</hi> honorably descended, the <hi>Praise of the Lord,</hi> according to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of his Name; he saued the life of his brother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Ioseph</hi> by his counsell,
<note place="margin">Gen 31.27.</note> moued no doubt euen by Gods Spirit so to doe: yet (by your leaue) he gaue aduice to sell him to the Ismaelites; hee went from his brethren, ioynes himselfe with the Cananites, marries into their stocke, defrauds <hi>Thamar</hi> of her husband, commits <hi>Incest</hi> with her, and cruelly adiudgeth her to be burnt. Heere is heaping of sin vpon sinne, as they which built <hi>Babell</hi> laid one bricke vpon another; and must he be the Tribe, euen the very Prince of it, whence the Holy and blessed <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of mankinde</hi> should descend?</p>
                     <p>Surely yea: for in him, that is, Christ, there was treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp all riches of grace,
<note place="margin">Col. 2 9.</note> and he indeede not to bee made noble by his stock or parentage, neither did the grosse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of his progenitors any whit disparage him; for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:24747:23"/>he clensed and purified all in his holy and vnspotted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. He could haue made choise of another race, but herein, herein appeared his wonderfull humilitie, abasing himselfe in that, wherein men for the most part are wont to be proud of, I meane bloud and parentage. The whole course of his life,
<note place="margin">Augustine.</note> witnessed his humilitie, <hi>Fecit te, fecit multa propter te;</hi> nay <hi>propter te fecit seipsum:</hi> He made thee, he made many things for thee; nay for thee he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.7.</note> VVhat? <hi>Of no reputation,</hi> saith <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 2.7. hee tooke vpon him the shape of a seruant, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto the death, euen vnto the death of the crosse. He humbled himselfe not onely in his death, but in his life; not onely in his life, but in his birth; not onely in his birth, but euen before his birth; in his race, in his descent, <hi>Ʋt qui pro peccatoribus moriturus erat,

First in regard of the ignominie and reproch of their birth, as that which comes forth with shame, and proceeds otherwise then that due course which God hath set downe. Secondly, because these through want of Gods blessing, seldome proue good: though I confesse the rule holds not alwaies;
<note place="margin">Heroum filij noxa Pro.</note> for Gods mercie hath a prerogatiue, and God will haue it appeare, that goodnesse is his gift, and that it comes not by propagation, or <hi>ex traduce</hi> from our parents; but for the most part, such off-spring, is vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and corrupt.

A third cause of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition was to extoll holy Marriage, and to aduance the houses and Families of them that liued chaste, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to keepe their vessels pure, that their posteritie might not be reiected, or depriued of this blessing. For if the Adulterous broode should haue had equall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of honour, and entrance into the congregation, with the <hi>righteous seede,</hi> holy wedlocke should haue growne into a contempt: but because God will stand by his owne ordinance, therefore he will reiect such adulterine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures with fastidiousnesse and disdaine.

<note place="margin">Gen. 3.7.</note> the sinne presented it selfe before him, as the sinne of <hi>Adam;</hi> the <hi>eyes</hi> of his iudgement and vnderstanding <hi>were opened,</hi> which at the first were dimmed, and dammed vp, that now he saw the foule errour he had committed, and no doubt his sinne <hi>lay at his doore;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 4.7.</note> his conscience pursues him, attaches him, condemnes him. <hi>Great is the power of conscience.</hi> He sees, he sees the greatnesse of his sinne, he knowes God is displeased, and therefore is touched with <hi>remorse</hi> for it. I say againe, <hi>Great is the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Eadem est index, eadem tortor, eadem Carcer. Ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa iudicat, ipsa accusat, ipsa damnat.</hi> It is both witnesse, iudge, prison, iaylor. It iudgeth, accuseth, and damneth perpetually. Wee neede no worse enemie then a guiltie conscience; It is like an ill conditioned wife, it makes a man euer range abroad, he neuer loues to be at home; he desires not the company of it: we thinke it our enemie, as <hi>Ahab</hi> both thought and spake of <hi>Elias.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Kings 21.20.</note> The rubs and checkes of conscience are full of restlesse terrours, as if it were vexed with furies. And surely little rest had <hi>Iudah,</hi> after sinne had set vp her rest. For when sinne comes into the heart,

Like <hi>Absoloms,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tops of their houses, open &amp; knowne to the world, to the high displeasure of Almightie God, abuse of holy Marriage, as if it were but a painted chaine, and to the shame and scandall of the whole Nation. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tels vs of a plague, that began at Ethiopia, from thence filled <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> killed <hi>Pericles,</hi> vexed <hi>Thueydides,</hi> and spread farre. I
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:24747:30"/>cannot tell what to say of plagues; but this I will be bold to speake, that as our sinnes spread, so the iudgements of God will spread likewise: If wee lengthen out our sinnes like Cartropes, his iudgements shall be like Cables; if we multiply our iniquities as the mole-hils of the earth, plagues and iudgements shall bee as the mountaines of God, of incomparable weight to fall vpon vs, and to crush vs in pieces. O consider this, yee that forget God in the breach of holy Marriage, the blessing of Paradise, the gate of life, the entrance into liuing, the seed-plot of heauen: I say not the bands to knit, but the bounds to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, restraine, confine mans posteritie in a right and a due course.

Say thou beest the greatest Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the countrey, or in the Court, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> in his mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers house;
<note place="margin">Gen. 39.9.</note>
                        <hi>None is greater in the house then I:</hi> And that through excellencie of wit, or eminencie of place, thou canst husband the fauours of Princes, for thy greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage; shall this protect thee in <hi>euill,</hi> shall it challenge any immunitie, or priuiledge to sinne?

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>all men</hi> must bee touched in conscience with the consideration of these particulars.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and practises of great men must bee no warrant to be are them our in sinne. <hi>The soule that sinneth</hi> (saith God) <hi>shall die the death:</hi> and euery one must answere for his own

                     <p>Secondly, if we must needs imitate them,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as the Apostle saith, <hi>I will shew you a more excellent way.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.31.</note> Obserue their vertues, and imitate them in their good examples: these, let vs approue, and approuing, let vs practise.

Meane men are stirred vp for the most part to follow and to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to that which most pleaseth their Princes: if it bee but to weare a garment, or tell a tale after them, or their fashion. Now if we applaud or imitate them in matters of indifferencie, how much better were it, in matters of piety and vertue? nay, how much worse is it, if in vice and sinne? Imitate not <hi>Peter</hi> in his periurie; but in his repentance and teares: nor <hi>Dauid</hi> in his Adulterie; nor <hi>Iudah</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest; but imitate them in their sorrow and contrition: la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be striken with the like <hi>remorse:</hi> quench thy lusts, abandon thy sinne, renounce thy pleasure, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his lasciuious Mistris, and God will receiue thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fauour againe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,

                        <hi>Iudah</hi> ye see had fallen into a grieuous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable sinne, yet he hath true <hi>remorse</hi> of conscience, and God in his mercy doth not cast him off:

                        <hi>The gifts and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God are without repentance:</hi> and whatsoeuer he hath decreed concerning any mans saluation shall stand; for his Election changeth not. The seale is surely fixt,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.19.</note>
                        <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his;</hi> and those which are once his, are his for euer: though they fall, yet shall they rise againe: and <hi>Dauid</hi> notwithstanding his Adulterie, shall be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his kingdome; and <hi>Peter</hi> notwithstanding his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,

Yet hence obserue two caueats. First, not to be secure or presumptuous, but rather worke out our saluation with feare and trembling. Secondly, when we haue seriously repented of any sinne, we must with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeh</hi> neuer fall into the same againe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, learne from hence, <hi>yee adulterers and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses,</hi>
